---The-CylinderOS-Project---

Thanks for contributing with The-CylinderOS-Project!

CylinderOS is an operating system in very early development and coded in python. At somepoint we hope to start transfering this to a Linux Kernal.

To run CylinderOS please download python and run the python file that you downloaded. The name is "Cylinder-Project.py"

We hope you enjoy CylinderOS and keep contributing to this project!

Thanks alot
